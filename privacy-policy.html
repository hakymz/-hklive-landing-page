          <li>IP address and location data (when permitted)</li>
          <li>

          </li>
          <li>Crash logs and usage analytics for performance improvement</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>c. Location Data</h3>
        <p>
          HK Live uses your location to show nearby users and improve match
          accuracy. You can disable location sharing in your device settings,
          but certain app features may be limited.
        </p>

        <h3>d. Cookies and Tracking Technologies</h3>
        <p>
          We use cookies and similar technologies to remember preferences,
          analyze usage trends, and personalize user experience. You may control
          cookies through your browser or device settings.
        </p>

        <h2>3. How We Use Your Information</h2>
        <p>Your information helps us to:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Register and manage your user account</li>
          <li>Match you with compatible profiles</li>
          <li>Provide chat, story, and notification features</li>
          <li>
            Process payments for premium subscriptions or in-app purchases
          </li>

          <li>Ensure user authenticity and prevent fraudulent activity</li>

        </ul>

        <!-- NEW SECTION: Verification Photos (AWS Rekognition) -->
        <h2>4. Verification Photos</h2>
        <p>
          During the optional verification process, we may request a selfie
          photo to confirm that the person creating the account matches the
          photos on their profile. This process uses AWS Rekognition to verify
          profile authenticity.
        </p>
        <p>
          Verification photos are used solely for the purpose of confirming
          profile authenticity. These photos are stored securely and are deleted
          after the verification review is completed. They are never shared with
          third parties. If a user deletes their account, all related
          data—including verification photos—is permanently removed.
        </p>

        <h2>5. Legal Basis for Processing</h2>
